The following is a list of context variables supported by certain solutions using the DiscernOutputViewer control. MPages and Discern Notify support the following context variables in CCLLINK and APPLINK. MPages also supports context variables in the REPORT_NAME and REPORT_PARAM preferences of the Discern Report component in Preference Maintenance (PrefMaint.exe). Context variables are useful for substituting runtime values from the current solution context during the execution of a Discern Explorer (CCL) program link. The variable names should be nested within dollar signs ($) in order to substitute the appropriate context data.
